# Hiya!

## I'm Matt Darby.

I've developed on the web for fifteen years. I do full stack web. I can configure pools of servers, architect and develop the applications on those servers, and make it all look good (and run). I have a Master's in Computer Science, am a Professor at Franklin University and I lead the Columbus Ruby Brigade. I've launched projects for folks from AT&T, Sprint, LivingSocial, SeoMoz, and Grange Insurance to local engineering and consulting firms. I’m at home with Ruby/Rails/Javascript/CSS, and am a big fan of the MeteorJS framework.

The rest of the information you’d likely want to see (Github, etc) are on my [site](http://matt-darby.com)
